# Agent Team Builder Refactoring Summary

## Overview

This refactoring project updated the Agent Team Builder to include PostgreSQL persistence, versioning, and new endpoints for managing agent teams. The core functionality of team building and execution was preserved while adding database integration.

## Completed Components

1. **Database Models**
   - Created `AgentTeam` and `AgentTeamConfigVersion` models in `src/config/db_models.py`
   - Implemented UUID primary keys and tenant-based multi-tenancy
   - Added soft-deletion support with `is_deleted` and `deleted_at` fields

2. **Database Migrations**
   - Implemented Alembic migrations for creating tables
   - Added versioning table for configuration history
   - Added soft-delete columns to the main team table

3. **Service Modules**
   - `TeamBuilderService` - Preserved core team assembly logic
   - `TeamExecutorService` - Preserved conversation execution logic
   - `TeamUpdaterService` - Added for updating teams with version tracking
   - `TeamDeleterService` - Added for soft-deleting teams

4. **API Endpoints**
   - `/build` - Create and persist a new team configuration
   - `/execute/{team_id}` - Execute a conversation with a stored team
   - `/update_team/{team_id}` - Update a team with version tracking
   - `/delete_team/{team_id}` - Soft-delete a team
   - `/restore_version/{team_id}/{version}` - Rollback to a previous version
   - `/version_history/{team_id}` - View version history
   - `/teams/{team_id}` - Get a team by ID
   - `/teams` - List all active teams
   - `/restore_team/{team_id}` - Restore a deleted team

5. **Testing**
   - Added tests for all new database operations and endpoints
   - Implemented proper mocking for service dependencies
   - Created in-memory SQLite database fixtures for tests

6. **Tooling & Scripts**
   - Updated PostgreSQL setup script
   - Created script for running migrations
   - Created script for running tests
   - Updated install scripts to use uv instead of pip

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Soft Deletion**
   - Teams are never physically deleted from the database
   - Setting `is_deleted=True` and `deleted_at` timestamp preserves history
   - Deleted teams can be restored with the API

2. **Version History**
   - Every update to a team creates a new version record
   - Previous versions remain available for reference or rollback
   - Rollbacks are implemented as new versions, not overwrites

3. **Database Integration**
   - FastAPI dependency injection for database sessions
   - SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations
   - PostgreSQL with JSON column type for flexible schema

4. **Unchanged Core Logic**
   - The core behavior in `TeamBuilderService` and `TeamExecutorService` remains unchanged
   - New functionality wraps around these existing services without modifying their behavior

## Future Considerations

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Add indexes on frequently queried columns
   - Consider caching for frequently accessed teams
   - Implement database connection pooling

2. **Additional Features**
   - Team duplication functionality
   - Team templates/blueprints
   - Team sharing across tenants

3. **Observability**
   - Add logging for database operations
   - Add telemetry for performance monitoring
   - Implement audit trail for sensitive operations
